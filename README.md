# USB RJ-45 Serial Dongle

A small USB to RS232 serial dongle, presented as a female RJ-45 jack that can be used with your choice of straight-through cable. Pinout is stanard Cisco RJ-45 console. Compatibility may vary with other vendors.

## Motivation

Commercial USB to Cisco-style serial cables are generally a single molded assembly, which means any issues with the RJ-45 jack (such as retention clip breaking) or forceful disconnection such as dropping your laptop, may neccesitate replacing the entire dongle.

By presenting a female RJ-45 jack, you now have the freedom to choose any length and quality of straight-through Ethernet cable, and replace it as clips break.
